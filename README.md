APC Project using Double linked list in C

Arithmetic Precision Calculator (APC) Using DSA in C

This project implements an Arithmetic Precision Calculator (APC) using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in the C programming language. The APC is designed to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers with high precision, overcoming the limitations of standard data types.

Features:

High Precision Calculations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large numbers.
Efficient Data Management:** Uses double linked lists to store and manipulate large numbers digit by digit.
Error Handling:** Validates input and manages calculation errors gracefully.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: C
Data Structures: Double linked lists for dynamic and efficient number representation.
Algorithms: Implemented for arithmetic operations on non-standard data sizes.
Usage:

Compile the project
gcc apc_project.c -o apc_project

Run the project
./apc_project

Future Improvements:
- Implement support for floating-point arithmetic.
- Add advanced operations like modular arithmetic and exponentiation.
- Develop a graphical or web-based interface for easier use.

This project demonstrates the effective use of DSA concepts in C to build a robust and precise arithmetic calculator capable of handling large numbers with accuracy.
